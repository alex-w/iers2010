# TODO List for iers
--------------------

## Fix Mock Tests
-----------------
test/should_not_compile does not work!

## ICGEM
---------

  * when parsing ICGEM file headers, only a number of error identifiers are 
  valid (e.g. 'calibrated_and_formal', 'calibrated', etc). Add 'empirical'.

  * add custom keyword/value pais so that we can store information like: 
  time_period which are non-standard.

### BUG
-------

  skipws should also handling a leading '+' sign in floating point. 
  std::from_chars does not allow for a leading '+' sign.

## SOLID_EARTH_TIDES
---------------------

  Displacement for SET differs from dehanttideinel respective results below 
  1mm but i am not hapy with that! Basically, the computation block that causes 
  the discrepancies is the diurnal corections for Step-2. I cannot get a hold 
  of how this stem corresponds to the paper of Mathews et al, 1997 (see 
  STEP2DIU.F).

  See the unit test code test/unit_tests/solid_earth_tide_displacement.cpp.
  The input (validation) data used therein are computed using dehanttideinel
